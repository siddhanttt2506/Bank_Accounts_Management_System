**Project Description:**

The Bank Accounts Management System is a portfolio project showcasing my skills in designing and developing a real-world application. This project simulates a system that manages bank accounts using PostgreSQL as the backend database. It aims to demonstrate my proficiency in database design, backend development, frontend development, security implementation, and more.

**Key Features:**

- Account Creation: Customers can open new accounts, while employees manage the process.
- Transaction Processing: Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- Account Management: Employees can view and manage account details.
- Audit Trail: System maintains an audit log for user activities.
- Reports and Analytics: Generate reports on account balances, transaction history, and more.
- Authentication and Authorization: Role-based access control for security.
- Data Validation: Prevent erroneous or unauthorized data entry.
- User-friendly Interface: Responsive frontend for smooth interactions.

**Technology Stack:**

- Backend: Python (Flask/Django)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Hashing, JWT
- Security: HTTPS, Role-based access control

**Installation and Setup:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tushar2704/bank-accounts-management.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bank-accounts-management`
3. Set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Set up PostgreSQL database and configure connection details in `config.py`.
7. Run the application: `python app.py`
8. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`
